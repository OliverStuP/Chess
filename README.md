# Chess

A chess simulator used to test my capabilities with Java and JFrame tools.

## Instructions

### Installation

- Download build from Github.
- Open Chess.jar file.

### How to play

The rules used here match what is used in the actual game. Details can be found here for those who are unfamiliar with the game [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess).

As this is build is primarily a simulation, A.I has yet to be designed for the opponent. The user must control both the white and black sides. As is the case with chess, the white side goes first. 

The player controls the game using the mouse. They must click on the piece they want to use. Once clicked, the squares that are available to the selected pieces will be shown in green. 

To reset the game, the player must click on the option provided in the Menu tab.
